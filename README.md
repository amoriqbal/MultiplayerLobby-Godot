# MultiplayerLobby-Godot
A Multiplayer Lobby to delve deep into the RPC protocols of Godot (Some Bluetooth and some Hacking :P)

What's there in a Lobby?
---
Well... everything that can be there in a multiplayer game, starts with a lobby!
Creating a server and letting people connect to it, is simple. You are connected to one right now, with your web browser.

 - Letting users know about the presence of others
 - Notifying them when someone leaves
 - Giving the users some way to know, if your server has suddenly crashed (your server cannot do it coz it _crashed_)
 - Letting them chat, group chat, send emoji's, kick others out.
These are somewhat simple too. (Somewhat!)

But is your lobby safe? Are you sure that someone out there, is not pretending to be the server, and accepting connections from inocent people, to fool them?
This is called a **Man in the Middle Attack**. This is one of the most popular, and possibly the easiest to envision. But there are many others that you cant even imagine of.
Let this repo walks you through interesting mishaps ;) that you can encounter while building your own lobby, chat system, or even a social-media platform.
